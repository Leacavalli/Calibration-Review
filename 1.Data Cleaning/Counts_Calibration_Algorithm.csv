"a multivariable regression of the modelled HIV prevalence against the prevalence of using professional injectors, heroin use, and frequent injecting across all cities was performed. Parameters sets for which the modelled regression coefficients lay within the 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) of those from the data regression were accepted, with all others rejected. Then, a second criterion was applied that the modelled regression R^2-value must lie within +/-25% of the data regression R^2-value.",1,"Other"

"the procedure by which 
the model was calibrated to these data is as follows: the model was run using 50000 parameter sets generated using Latin hypercube sampling in which certain parameters are allowed to vary within defined ranges (appendix p 24); for each parameter set the likelihood of the observed survey data given the corresponding modelled outputs was calculated. The ten parameter sets with the highest likelihood were selected for use in all 
further model analyses",1,"Other"
